Contributing License Installation

Firebase Setup:

Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/). Enable the following Firebase services for your project: Authentication Firestore (Database) Storage (File storage) Realtime Database (Optional for chat functionality) Install the Firebase CLI globally: Bash npm install -g firebase-tools Use code with caution. Initialize Firebase in your project directory: Bash firebase init Use code with caution. Follow the prompts to select features (Authentication, Firestore, etc.) and configure them for your project. Start the development server:

Bash npm start Use code with caution. This will typically start your React app on http://localhost:3000 (or a different port depending on your configuration).

Features

Post and Video Uploading:
Users can upload images, videos, or text-based posts. Utilize Firebase Storage to store uploaded media files. Use Firestore to store post metadata (content, author, timestamps, etc.). Display uploaded posts in an appropriate UI component. Likes and Comments:

Users can like and comment on posts. Store likes and comments as subcollections in Firestore documents for efficient querying and updates. Update the UI to reflect likes and comments in real-time (consider using Cloud Firestore listeners or a suitable state management library). Chat Functionality (Optional):

Implement real-time chat between users using Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore. Consider using a library like Socket.IO or a third-party chat service if needed. User Search:

Enable users to search for other users by username or other relevant fields. Use Firestore's built-in querying capabilities or Cloud Search for more advanced search features. Profile Management:

Allow users to edit their profile information, profile picture, etc. Store user profile data in Firestore collections or documents. Post Saving:

Permit users to save posts from other users for future reference. Implement a "Saved Posts" feature using Firestore or a dedicated collection for saved content. Contributing
